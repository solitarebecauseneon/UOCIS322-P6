## Description
The application builds upon the one presented in project 5. Now, the pre-existing web interface exists. However, using
a new client page, one can retrieve customized data from the database that was stored by the web interface created in
project 5. The web application accesses a flask page (website.py) which communicates with an api (api.py) to collect
the correct information in the proper format and return it to the main page (index.html)
